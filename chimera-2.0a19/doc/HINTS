This is really kind of sparse.

---------
Compiling
---------

If you're unsure if chimera will compile then try the simplest thing:

cp Common.tmpl.dist Common.tmpl
xmkmf
make Makefiles depend clean all

I use HAVE_xxx_H defines to allow users with systems that don't
have all of the standard header files to easily weed them out of
the compilation.  I also use HAVE_xxx where xxx is a function
that doesn't appear in every system (e.g. the POSIX function mktime())
but the source can make allowances for this.
Some functions are included in common that are required but that
don't appear everywhere.  You can have them linked in by specifying
the proper NEED_xxx thing in Common.tmpl.  Check common/Imakefile for
a current list.

If you have trouble doing the simplest thing, please let me know
so that I can try to fix the problem.  You should only have to
change Common.tmpl.  If you figure out what needs to be done to
get it to compile (like adding a #if defined() thing in Common.tmpl
with the proper defines set for a particular machine), please send
it to me so that I can include it.  Of course, I can't guarantee that
I will include all contributions.

If you need to specify site-dependent defines or libraries then
search for SITE_* in Common.tmpl and add them there.

Also, if you need to force the compiler to something special (say, gcc)
then remove 'XCOMM' from the line (in Common.tmpl):

XCOMM CC = gcc

and change the compiler to whatever you need.

---------
Resources
---------

There are two types of resources used by chimera.  X/GUI resources
and, for lack of a better term, chimera resources.  Chimera resources
are formatted exactly like the X resources but are loaded separately.

I strongly recommend that you do not use an app-defaults file unless
you really want to change the appearance.  I'm not even going to
try to produce an example...you're on your own here or you can
ask the bug-chimera list for examples (there are clever folks that
will probably get around to this one of these days).

If you install an older version of chimera that installed an app-defaults
file then you should remove it or if you need it because 1.65 or some
other version needs it then you can run 2.0 with the command:

XFILESEARCHPATH="" chimera-2.0

By default, chimera looks for its own resources in ~/.chimera/resources.
I recommend you create the directory ~/.chimera since most of the
defaults for chimera will point to this directory for files.  One
possible resources file:

bookmark.filename: ~/.chimera/bookmarks.html
cache.directory: ~/.chimera/cache
cache.persist: true
chimera.homeURL: http://www/
html.propFontPattern: -adobe-helvetica-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1
view.capFiles: ~/.chimera/mailcap:~/.mailcap

------------
app-defaults
------------
Don't use them with Chimera v2.  If you have an app-defaults file that
you need for Chimera v1 then you should create a script that
changes XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so that it doesn't look at the default
app-defaults directory.
