	cached documents can be reused without setting the cache

	to make sure the code kept track of downloads more correctly.
Added code to html/inline.c to make sure that when the reload flag is set
	that an inline is only reloaded once.
Added code to www/context.c to look for the www.maxDownloads resource to
	set the maximum number of concurrent downloads.
Added/fixed the code that actually limits the number of concurrent downloads.

FTP code communicates failures back up the handler chain.  Probably needs
	more work but should work better.
Code in common/ml.c took a dump when untagged text showed up.
	Should be fixed now.
The accept list is now taken in account when searching to see if a current

Added code to look at www.printLoadMessages resource.
Markup language parser code in common/ml.c revised to work a bit better.

Added code to highlight tags when selected.
If the first document is not HTML then no HTML fonts are created but

	mark olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
Lots of reworked code in html/.

alpha 169-170
-------------

Worked on main/download.c to make downloads behave a little better.
Added patch for 1x1 interlaced GIF problem.
	Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>
Changed the MIME code to try to make it a bit faster.  Changes had to
	be made all over the place.

alpha 166-168
-------------
Added file.autoLoad resource.  If defined then the file protocol checks
	to see if the URL specifies a directory and, if it does, checks to
	see if the file specified in file.autoLoad exists in that
	directory and loads it instead of a directory listing.
Added patch to fix alignment problem in mempool.c.
	"J.D.Coleman" <J.D.Coleman@newcastle.ac.uk>
Code in proto/http.c no longer cares about the useRedirect resource.
Let HTTP error messages display instead of trying to trap the messages
	in proto/http.c.
Fixed cache flag bug in proto/http.c.
Removed -Wmissing-* because it caused old versions of gcc to become upset.
Made sure inputs for forms are removed from any lists they might be
	in when they're destroyed because the two-pass thing that
	happens for tables causes a whole heap of trouble.
If a cache directory can't be found then a message is printed on stderr.
The environment variable WWW_HOME can be used to specify the first document.
URLParse always returns "/" instead of a NULL or zero-length filename.

	in the middle of a row caused trouble.
Dialogs now have one label area instead of two.

alpha 164
---------
Switched over to Alignment struct/union thing in common/mempool.c.
	Markku Savela <msa@hemuli.tte.vtt.fi>.
Got rid of trouble-causing arguments in www/WWW.c.

alpha 163
---------
Commented out table debugging code.
Re-enabled comment parsing in common/ml.c.
common/mempool.c uses MEMPOOL_ALIGNSIZE to determine the alignment size.
	The default is sizeof(size_t).
Boxes accessing related data after the data was destroyed causing
	seg violation in html/module.c:HTMLDestroy.  Do box destruction
	first.
Messages for downloading and other activities should appear in the
	shell(s) that apply.  Added extra field to the file dialog so that
	file operation messages will appear in the right spot.

	Steven E Lumos <slumos@CS.UNLV.EDU>
Made Common.tmpl.dist style a bit more consistent.
Added patch submitted in 1994(!) to map URLs to other URLs using
	regular expressions.  Theodore Ts'o <tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU>
	This has been disabled for now for performance reasons.
When a new head/shell is started the cut buffer is examined for a URL.
	If there is a valid URL at the beginning then it will be loaded.
	Changed main/main.c.
In url.c:URLParse look for other separators not just '/' before ':'.
Revampled www/request.c:WWWBuildRequest to make it more efficient hopefully.
Baseline should be fixed for forms widgets.
Switched over to using snprintf and fixed size buffers in a few
	places.  Mostly in message handling.  Included code for snprintf
	from LPRng-2.4.2.
www/mime.c:MIMEFindData searched one byte too far which caused really
	all sorts of irritating trouble.

alpha 162
---------
Added LinuxArchitecture to Common.tmpl.dist
Proportional scaling of table columns added to html/table.c.
Added BSD386Architecture to Common.tmpl.dist
Baseline code for inline images fixed.
Referenced NULL pointer in SubmitCallback fixed in html/form.c.
Table width was ending up as 0 (probably a bug) which was later used
	in a division.  Fixed to not cause SIGFPE.
All traces of the app-defaults file removed (hopefully).
Right floating objects should now float to the right hand side even if there
	aren't enough objects to push it to the edge.
<td> or <th> before a <tr> looks bad but shouldn't cause a core file
	to appear.
Missing 'l' in 'lenv' in HTMLOListEnd in html/list.c.
	Added NetBSDArchitecture to Common.tmpl.dist
	Added missing definitions to common/common.h for functions in
	common/list.c "J.D.Coleman" <J.D.Coleman@newcastle.ac.uk>
Fixed other random table weirdness (my powers of description are stretched
	to the max with some of this sludge I'm writing).

alpha 112-161

Added GPL.
Added Rob McMullen's TextField widget.
Incorporated patch for numbering ordered lists.
	Jake Kesinger <kesinger@math.ttu.edu> ?
Added patch for dealing with malloc failures to the image/ code.
	Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>

  a document is passed to the renderer for it to deal with.
Fixed anchor handling in the HTML code.
Added for check "id" attribute.  Erik Corry <erik@kroete2.freinet.de>
The HTML code now has a timeout that will destroy an inline if it
  takes too long to find its size.
Moved the cache code into www/.
  
alpha 110
---------
Frames are refreshed when they are resized.
Made changes to html/* to improve HTML handling.
Comments are handled slightly differently in common/ml.c.
FreeBSD added to Common.tmpl.dist.
Added support for the dreaded <center> tag.

alpha 109
---------
Fixed MEMPOOL_DEBUG usage in the defintion of pool.  common/mempool.c.
NULL pointer accessed in www/frame.c:FrameQuery() sometimes when
  source requested.  Ben Taylor <bent@snm.com>
Added http.useRedirect resource which makes HTTP 302s act like 301s.
Fixed SELECT form problems and cleaned up the code.  Did the same for
  the textarea code.
Fixed MxwGetFont()...was always returning NULL.
Reworked CallTagHandler() a bit.
XMP added...acts like PRE.
Clone will really do a clone now...the URL is taken from the cloned
  window.  The resource chimera.cloneHome can be set to force the
  clone to use the home page.
Listing and XMP should work correctly now.
HTML code reworked a bit.
Line 235 in www/frame.c used frame->fcontext instead of value like it
  was supposed to.
Fixed a problem with bookmarks...the element handler wasn't handling
  elements correctly.

alpha 108
---------
Fixed problems in html/form.c.  Reworked things a bit.  Still in bad
  shape.

alpha 107
---------
Changed proportional font default pattern in html/font.c.  Big win.
  Rob McMullen <rwmcm@hydra.ae.utexas.edu>
Added patch to fix 'ENDIAN' preprocessor goodies in image/ and
  fix homeless startup crash.  Erik Corry <erik@kroete2.freinet.de>
Cleaned up frame and proto handling code in www/proto.c and www/frame.c
Made the connection count code in www/proto.c work.
Pressing "source" won't cause a reload.  Created FrameRedisplay().
Doing a reload caused all subsequent loads to inherit the reload flag.
Put a line in Common.tmpl to show where you can force a special compiler.
Added margins to the HTML renderer.  Defaults to 20.
Tags are handled the old way...if tags are overlapped then end tags
  are simulated to eliminate overlap.
Changed font code so that the fixed fonts work the same way as the
  proportional fonts.
Fixed bookmark create problems.  Strings were not being allocated
  correctly...they were auto vars that got wiped out.
Worked on the markup parsing.  Seems to handle comments and stuff in
  general more correctly.  Simplified Element handling and made all of
  the 'common/ml' types opaque.  More function calls!  Less mucking
  with internals!
Worked on HTML list handling...didn't handle bad HTML as well as it
  could.
Added better isspace() called isspace8().
  Erik Corry <erik@kroete2.freinet.de>

alpha 106
---------
Parentless frames needed a fake parent ID to prevent collions with
  real parent IDs.  Solves all sorts of terrible problems.
Added external viewer code.  Had to rearrange www/proto.c, www/frame.c, and
  create src/view.c.  Should be faster.
Made a whole bunch of changes to the HTML renderer to better deal with
  errors and to a problem that caused paragraphs (and other tags) to wipe
  out previous tag environments.
Redirect URLs are correctly passed back from protocol handlers to the URL
  stack.  HTTP passes it back for status "Moved permanently" only.
Forms fixed.  Multi-selects work internally (how useful!).  Form image
  works.
Won't crash if no bookmarks are available.
Cache now uses an integer ID for the filename that is kept in the
  cache index.  Unfortunately, you can only have 2^31 cache entries
  on most machines.
HTTP code was looking for the location: field and ignoring the status.
  Nexus server returns location field even when status was not 300-399.
  This caused a nifty loop.
GET /something?mumble queries failed because it was assumed to be NULL
  terminated but wasn't necessarily NULL terminated.
FrameDestroy() was not free'ing everything.
Bookmark now works when there is no bookmark file.

alpha 104-105
-------------
InitModule_Message() was not initializing ProtoHooks correctly.
  Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>
Source button works now.
Simplified the code in www/io.c...it was getting too hairy without
  providing any benefits.
Renamed functions in www/ and other places to something more reasonable.
Changed the behavior of MLMultiGetText() so that it is more reasonable
  to use.
Reworked the forms code a bit: textarea and option text collection
  is simpler.
I note the following typo:
    cfh102-2.0/www/mime.c: { image/x-xpimap, xpm },
    Michael Kellen <michael@xph029.physics.montana.edu>
Moved the stuff in misc/ to proto/.
Updated README.hints.
Changed the download code so that a save file requester appears at the
  end of the transfer instead of an entire screen in the main display.
<tr> causes a line break.
HTMLQuery() in module/html.c could not deal with a NULL title.
Rearranged and messed around with code to try to get the memory
  usage down a bit.
Bookmark code now works pretty much the way it did in 1.65.  Bookmark file
  is an HTML-like file.  changes in src/
Added resource to set the maximum length of a cache filename length.
  See lib/resources for details.  I can't remember who asked me for this.
Messed around with Common.tmpl and the Imakefiles to make it easier for
  me.
Fixed line layout code to take baselines into account to make
  the "align" attribute work.  Changed a bunch of stuff in html/
*/* is added to the end of the accept string.  Changed proto/http.c.
URL resolution fixed and simplified slightly.  '..' caused problems
  and things like '//' were not removed which messed up the cache.
  Added common/dir.c and modified www/url.c.
Made lots of worthless cosmetic changes to the functions in html/.
Added check for _SSIZE_T and _SIZE_T to common/common.h
Added image input field to forms support.
Fixed FTP.  Broke in 103.
InitModule_File wasn't initializing structure properly.  proto/file.c changed.
Forms code memory overrun.  html/form.c changed.

alpha 103
---------
Readded code to use the base filename of a URL as the default name
  for saving stuff.
aXe scrolling text widget removed.
The title was not being terminated at the right time in AddBookmark() in
  src/bookmark.c.
Support for <note> tag added.
  Jake Kesinger <kesinger@math.ttu.edu>

alpha 102
---------
A colon delimited list of filenames can be specified for the dbFiles
  resource.
URL failure was not being reported back to the parent frame.  This caused
  HTML rendering to stop forever waiting for the image.  Partially fixed.
  Reported by Karl Eichwalder <ke@ke.Central.DE>.
Added support for the size attribute for form text input.
  Larry Doolittle <doolitt@recycle.cebaf.gov> 
Paragraph align attribute was being carried over into the following
  paragraphs if the aligned paragraph didn't have an end tag.  Fixed.
  Reported by Karl Eichwalder <ke@ke.Central.DE>
Feeling silly...added some support for frames.  html/frame.c.
Cleaned up the URL load code in HTML and shoved it in html/load.c.
HandleSelect() was causing trouble if called for </select> but there
  was never a <select>.  Should be fixed.  Lycos needs a better
  HTML editor.
Added PNG patches/additions.  Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>
Changed www/mime.c to add PNG filename extensions.
Cache index file format is HTML.
Fixed the blockquote nesting stuff.  Looks like it was coded to
  prevent nested blockquotes.  Probably sleepy that night.
  Spotted by Jake Kesinger (kesinger@math.ttu.edu)
Ordered lists kind of work.  "Regular" Decimal only.  Formatting needs work.
  Spotted by Jake Kesinger (kesinger@math.ttu.edu)

alpha 101
---------
Fixed problem where an element was being created for text for the empty
  string between two tags.
Rearranged frame.c and proto.c internals.
HTML module only resizes every 10th line.

HTML module now looks for '#' goodies on URLs.
The scrollbar position is remembered.
IOCreateStream now checks for NULL hostname.
Changed the name of libimage.a to libximage.a and libmisc.a to libxmisc.a
  because IRIX has libraries with the reason names.

alpha 100
---------
In TextareaText() and OptionText(), the length was initialized wrong
  the first time around.  Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>
Fixed problem in url.c...input data was being copied incorrectly.
  Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>
MemPoolCreate() allocates space with the initial descriptor to
  reduce the number of malloc()'s.
proto/http.c looks for "Pragma: no-cache".
FrameEndData() was checking for the add hook when it wanted to call
  the end hook.
Cache changes:
  Added size limit, persistence flag, and cleaned up the header
  read code.  Still need to add TTL code.
common/common.h makes sure that FILENAME_MAX is defined.
Added patch to proto/ftp.c and www/url.c to make non-anonymous FTP work.
  Michael Kellen <michael@xph029.physics.montana.edu>
Textarea text and option text/values are now allocated with the mempool
  functions.  Changes in html/form.c.
Title and style text (I ran into an HTML3 document with style and it was
  annoying...) are collected in one chunk instead of realloc'd.  Changes
  in layout.c, layout.h, test.c, layout.c, form.c.
Moved the markup language parsing thing to common/ml.c so that it can
  be used easily in other places.  Made gratuitous changes at the same
  time to structure names.  Required thrashing around in html/.
  Probably introduced a whole bunch of new bugs.
Readded bookmark feature.  Bookmarks can be added and loaded but not
  editted.  Bookmark file is an HTML file.
Added code to allow mempool to revert to malloc()'s for every memory grab
  so that Electric Fence/dmalloc/whatever will make more sense with chimera.
Downloads are no longer associated with frames.  This is to allow multiple
  frames to access the same document without having to hit the cache
  for their own copy.  Reduces memory usage and eliminates a lot of disk cache
  accesses.
Handling of HTTP redirects changed.

alpha 99
--------
free_mem() was called too soon in ImageDestroy()
  Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>
For loop counter initialized incorrectly in LayoutSetupFonts().
  Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>
Readded #ifdef HAVE_JPEG to image/image.c.
Probably fixed the problem with a word appearing at the end of the line
  and at the beginning of the next because it was drawn too soon.
Fixed problem in image/jpeg.c:
  lf_finish_decompress() doesn't check the return value of
  jpeg_finish_output(), which sometimes leaves things in the wrong
  state.  Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>

alpha 98
--------
Fixed problem pointer problem in html/font.c.
  Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>
Straightened out common/mempool.c and combined common.h and mempool.h.
URLParts are allocated using the MemPool functions.
MIME functions use MemPool for allocations.
Cache no longer caches documents with auth information or return
  data.
Fixed (I think) endless loop problem when a HTTP redirect occurred.
Added a resolver function to the protocol and render module search.
  Allows the application to define a function that can load modules
  on the fly.
Added callback definitions to catch stupid mistakes.
Reworked the I/O messages a bit.

alpha 97
--------
Added code to allow a module to override the render hooks for a frame.
  Reason: the HTML module needs to trap button presses for inline images.
  Required changes to the Frame definition, html/inline.c, www/action.c,
  and www/frame.c.

alpha 96
--------
Made more changes to every directory for the Frame type change.
Made buffer allocations for the next stream read larger to reduce the number
  of allocations.

alpha 95
--------
Added size_t in some places.
Added HAVE_STDDEF_H (check out common/common.h).
Frames are no longer widgets.  This is to allow modules to create
  invisible frames for non-X renderers (audio, postscript, ...).
  Required a lot of changes in www/.

alpha 94
--------
Fixed a problem where the widgets used by the download renderer were not
  removed.  Michael Kellen <michael@xph029.physics.montana.edu>
Cache simplified...removed memory caching.
Fixed problem in HTTP: data was being wiped out by the buffer
  replacement code when content-length is found.
DocumentDestroy() now does the whole job.
Removed the render caching from the image module.
Commented the special color allocator in image/image.c because it was
  having troubles with narrow images...fix later.
Sort of fixed the FTP code.
Added some resource string lookups to reduce the dependency on
  hardcoded strings.
Hacked the font code in the HTML module.  Attempts to pick the best
  choices from a list specified by a pattern.
Fixed a problem in TitleText() and AuthorText() in html/text.c.  The running
  length was wrong.
Fixed a potential memory leak problem and other things in proto/file.c.
Fixed URLHash()...length given to MD5 function was wrong.
Mucked around misc/cache.c.

alpha 93
--------
Made memory cache read gradual.
Changed www/io.c to act more like the alpha 80 version (more stable)
  and it also returns growing buffers which requires content handlers
  to keep track of offsets instead of addresses into the buffer
  before FrameEndData() is called because realloc_mem() could cause
  the addresses to become invalid.
Fixed the HTML code to deal with the new www/io.c buffer policy.
Applied patch to proto/http.c that fixed an initialization problem and
  added NULL checks to www/proxy.c. Erik Corry ehcorry@inet.uni-c.dk
Inserted missing 'else' in CacheMemRead().
URL display works correctly again.
WM_PROTOCOL delete is handled again.
Added all sorts of swell progress messages.
A file based XrmDatabase is used for the message database.
Handling HTTP/0.x in proto/http.c fixed.

alpha 92
--------
Forms stuff has been reenabled.  Sort of works.
The download stuff is a bit more reasonable but not by much.
Noodled around a bit...added a defintion for conversion modules.
Moved the message protocol to misc.

alpha 91
--------
FrameEndData wasn't checking the closure argument which caused seg fault.
  Smarasderagd <smar@reptiles.org>
Added patch that added comments to image/image.c, proxy matching code,
  and  bug fixes.  Erik Corry <ehcorry@inet.uni-c.dk>
Changed the image code endian header stuff so that I don't get
  yelled at again :) Michael Kellen <michael@xph029.physics.montana.edu>
The cancel button sort of works.  The inlines don't get cancelled.
GIF patches that fixed the endless loop problem and some other
  problems.  Shigeru Yamamoto <shige-y@is.aist-nara.ac.jp>
GIF patch that fixed problems with interfaced 2-color GIFs.
  Erik Corry <ehcorry@inet.uni-c.dk>  	
Added patch that reduced memory usage in proto/file.c, added
  HAVE_STRING_H to proto/error.c (now message.c), and fixed prototype
  in image/image.c.  Larry Doolittle <doolitt@recycle.cebaf.gov>
Downloading sort of works.  The filename is hardcoded.
Cache code got rearranged.  The cache read code is a protocol module
  and the cache write code is a render module.
Error/status messages are now loaded with a URL of the form
  x-message:message_name.

alpha 81-90
-----------
Rearranged everything.  Look at the code.

alpha 78-80
-----------
Tons of patches for the color/image handling code.
  Erik Corry ehcorry@inet.uni-c.dk
The y coordinate of the rectangle to refresh in CreateRenderLine() was
  set to the x coordinate which caused the bottom edge of the
  visible area to not be refreshed.
Placement of text and other items has changed.  Changes in text.c and
  layout.c.
 
alpha 77
--------
Incorporated the second big patch to the color/image handling code.
  Erik Corry ehcorry@inet.uni-c.dk
Problem with anchor text having leading spaces fixed.
Added patch to WWWLayout() that makes it smarter when picking the next
  part to handle.  Larry Doolittle <doolitt@recycle.cebaf.gov>
Various other changes that I don't remember.
Fixed problem with start anchor tag and missing end anchor tag.

alpha 76
--------
Revised the way inline.c handles inline images mostly to deal with the
  changes below...
xloadimage/ is now image/ and now has a generic interface to the image
  code.
Code changes for dealing with determining when a part can be rendered.
  Always use IsRenderable().

alpha 75
--------
Added a big wad of important changes for much improved color
  handling.  Patches made in common, www, and xloadimage.
  Erik Corry ehcorry@inet.uni-c.dk

alpha 74
--------
Number of inputs miscounted in form.c which caused overrun of malloc'd
  space in SubmitCallback().
NameValueToURLEncoded() in form.c fixed.
Bug in the select/option tags fixed.  Without a value attribute the
  option value got screwed up.
Added an error message in LoadDocument() for when the URL is invalid.
Readded the external protocol stuff except that the name is kind of
  changing to "local proxy" and it is specified using environment
  variables like the regular proxy.

alpha 73
--------
Moved the HandleMumble() functions from layout.c just because.
Added patch to wwwio/document.c to fix a problem with "no_proxy"
  handling.  Erik Corry <erik@kroete2.freinet.de>
Added patch to xloadimage/gif.c to make it deal with broken GIFs
  better.  Erik Corry <erik@kroete2.freinet.de>
Fixed space insertion in filled text.  Its slow but it works.
Fixed introduced problem with <hr>.
Blockquote was formatted wrong.
  Erik Corry <erik@kroete2.freinet.de>
Fixed problem with anchor not being terminated by beginning of
  next anchor.
Missing #include <sys/types.h> added.
  Kenichi Chinen <k-chinen@is.aist-nara.ac.jp>
Error messages should show up more often (instead of never).

alpha 72
--------
Resizing is still a disaster.  Reloads a document completely.  Have to
  leave it for now.
Made some improvements (hopefully) to the resizing of the clip, child,
  and scrollbar widgets.  Right margin should look correct now.

alpha 71
--------
Improved memory situation.  Memory for the rendering stuff is allocated
  in chunks of BUFSIZ.  Makes things simpler, I hope.  Makes it
  faster for huge documents.
Fixed problem in tag parser.  Trailing whitespace caused a problem.
Added event callbacks for render parts.
Removed all cache code.
URL handling changed.  Input data is passed in one big junk instead of in
  name/value pairs.
Added authentication stuff.  Something is wrong but its close.

alpha 70
--------
Cache setup simplified.  Got rid of the cache info files.  Cache still
  disabled by default, though, because the widget is messed up and
  image stuff doesn't work right with the cache for some reason.
<LI> indents are nicer.
brokenHTML is True by default.
Fixed problem in TextareaText() in forms.c.  Length wrong in realloc
  section.  Same problem in OptionText()!
Fixed silly problem in AddEntry() in form.c.
Messed around in WWW.c.  Added a PreferredGeometry function.  Still
  messed up.
Changed the way memory is allocated for RenderParts and the element
  specific structure.  Required changes in lots of places.  Simplified
  some stuff.
PREText and PlainText have been combined and made more efficient (hopefully)
  in text.c.
Took out DestroyURLParts() in SubmitCallback() in form.c.  Caused
  a seg fault sometimes.  Now we have another memory leak.
Fixed ConfigureWidgets() so that the width and height of the document
  are kept within the range of Dimensions.  It really sucks that
  Dimension is a 16 bit value.  Need to get rid of the hardcoded
  values.

alpha 69
--------
Added brokenHTML resource to relax the HTML parser.
The request field was not being initialized in http_main.
On the first pass of rendering/layout objects are not drawn if they are
  not on the screen.  Duh.

alpha 68
--------
Check boxes were broken.  Should be fixed now.
Radio boxes should work now.
Weird whitespace in forms is turned into a space.
Fixed HTML parsing problems.  Probably introduced more problems but now
  it survives at least one test page :)  Need to get SGML manual from
  Allen.

alpha 65-67
-----------
More forms work.  Mucked with internal tag handling stuff.  Nothing fun.
Made image refreshing work a little better, hopefully.
Added BLOCKQUOTE.
Fixed tag handling again.
Added blank lines in front of some block structure tags to flush a line of
  text before the new attributes take effect.
Check for NULL method added in wwwio/http.c.

alpha 63-64
-----------
Started work on forms.  Some stuff works.  Does not do well on Digital's
  test.
Fixed bad problem in DestroyRenderPartList().  Who's stupid idea was it
  to put similarly named next fields in RenderPart?
Made some other changes.  Don't remember what they were.
Removed what little support there was for old versions of X stuff.

alpha 62
--------
Fixed redirection handling.  Handles "Location".  Needs to handle "URI".
Did some work to the scrollbars.
Widget now handles title and author.
Adding bookmarks works.
Reworked the refresh code.  Should be faster.  Images won't refresh much
  faster because XImage is used so my 4MB X terminal doesn't poop out.
URL window allows user entry again.

alpha 58-61
-----------
An I/O stream will timeout after 10 seconds.
Number of downloads can be limited.
Source works.  Problem is that it reloads the document which is a problem
  if the document is regenerated each time it is accessed and you don't
  get a cache hit and you need to see the original.
Changed the names of some structures with bad historical names.
Rearranged layout handling code to trigger as a callback to the
  HTML parsing code.
FillText() uses unsigned char so that isspace() doesn't get confused.
  This fixes (I hope) the problem with some entity goodies not showing
  up.
ReadStreamHandler() allocates memory in multiples of BUFSIZ.
Fixed/broke/rearranged a bunch of stuff that I don't remember.
Source changed so that an editor is fork()'d.  I'll try to change it
  back later.  Problem is that switching source during a download can
  cause big trouble and I didn't want to do an IOStop().
Resize works.  Same problems as with source so I do an IOStop().  Grrr.

alpha 11-57
-----------
Rewrote everything (almost).  Got rid of NCSA's HTML widget and rolled
  my own HTML parsing and rendering code.
ftp_error_message free()'d a string literal.
  Dick Streefland <dicks@knoware.nl>

alpha 10
--------
HTML widget changed a lot.  Expose and reformat code changed.
Changed the title/message widget to just a plain pane (basically).
Added anchor URL display.
  Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de> 

alpha 1-9
---------
Complete rewrite of the I/O handling code.  Socket select is now handled
  by the Xt event loop.  Moved net code, pseudo-MIME stuff, and caching
  code to its own directory.  The main UI code has been reworked to
  deal with the event-based I/O code.  HTML widget image handling
  heavily modified.
Added patch to HTMLimages.c to fix scanline padding and depth
  handling.  Or something.  Jim Rees <rees@umich.edu>
Added patch to make the download filename the same as the URL filename.
  Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
Made changes to content-type handling as per the suggestion of Roman who
  went and read RFC 1521 and 1524.
Made patch to url.c.
  Martin Stiftinger <stifting@iue.tuwien.ac.at>
Added strlen(anchor) to MakeURL.  I think Martin made this fix too.  I
  don't remember.  Thanks to both of course.
  Larry Doolittle <doolitt@recycle.cebaf.gov>
Added patch to local.c so that local file directory listings contain
  lots of useful information.  Didn't include the FTP part because it
  won't work on all FTP servers.  Patch is at
  http://xph029.physics.montana.edu/chimera/filesize.patch if you 
  would like to try it.  It needs work for 2.0...
Added patch for SGML escape stuff. Jim Rees <rees@umich.edu>
Patch to HTML.c to make scrolling work right.
  Leonard N. Zubkoff <lnz@dandelion.com>
Made attempt to make sure POSIX header files are included.  Not done
  yet.

2.x
---
Complete rewrite.
